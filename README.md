# bwv-884-fugue-analysis

This is my ongoing analysis of Bach's G Major Fugue (BWV 884) from
book two of the Well Tempered Clavier. I've used the latest Henle Urtext as
source material, but have separated out all three parts and am adding markings
for the themes, episodes, sequences, etc.

I'm using Gnu Lilypond for typesetting.
