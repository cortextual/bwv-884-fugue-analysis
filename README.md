# bwv-583-fugue-analysis

This is my ongoing analysis of Bach's D Sharp Minor Fugue (BWV 583) from
book one of the Well Tempered Clavier. I've used the latest Henle Urtext as
source material, but have separated out all three parts and am adding markings
for the themes, inverted themes, and episodes.

I'm using Gnu Lilypond for typesetting.
